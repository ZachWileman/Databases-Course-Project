## Databases-Course-Project
This project currently is currently up-and-running at the web address: [here](http://zachwileman.byethost17.com). 
For now, its up and running for people to look at, but due to the free web hosting service I'm using, its not
guaranteed to stay up.

## Project Idea
The idea for this project was to create a website that acted similar to the site Amazon. Users are able to create
an account, have multiple addresses, add items to their cart, and purchase items. This site also features error and
success message allowing the user to be more informed of what is going on. This website was implemented with php (Back-end)
and Bootstrap(Front-end), and also uses a MySQL database to store inventory and user information.
